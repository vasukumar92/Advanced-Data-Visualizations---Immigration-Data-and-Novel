# Advanced-Data-Visualizations---Immigration-Data-and-Novel
Dataset: Immigration to Canada from 1980 to 2013 - International migration flows to and from selected countries - The 2015 revision from United Nation's website  The dataset contains annual data on the flows of international migrants as recorded by the countries of destination. The data presents both inflows and outflows according to the place of birth, citizenship or place of previous / next residence both for foreigners and nationals. I have focused on the Canadian Immigration data.  For the word cloud generation I have also used a text file of Alice in the Wonderland Novel.
